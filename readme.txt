If the navigation section does not appear, this is probably because your theme is unable to handle the tag for splitting the page. So you need to add the following code in your single.php loop:

<code><?php wp_link_pages(); ?></code>

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire 'tkc-sliced-post' directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate TKC Sliced Post through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
